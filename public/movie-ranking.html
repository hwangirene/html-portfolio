<h1>Irene's Movie Reviews</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Guardians of the Galaxy</h3>
<p>A new spin on traditional super hero movies -- really fun and funny to watch with a great soundtrack!</p>
<h3>Everything Everywhere All At Once</h3>
<p>Quirky movie but loved the all Asian cast and the themes around family, sacrifice, and identity.</p>
<h3>Lion King</h3>
<p>My favorite classic Disney movie with the catchiest soundtrack.</p>
