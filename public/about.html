<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Mission-driven, design and product leader with cross-disciplinary experience across product strategy, UX and service design, user research, product management, engineering, and data analytics. An all-around generalist born out of working in early-stage, 0-to-1 start-ups with a focus in emerging markets and underserved communities. Equal parts problem definer and problem solver, unfazed by challenges and ambiguity, and a strong systems thinker. </p>

<p>Currently looking for my next social good opportunity and in the meantime, picking up new skills in data analytics and web development.</p>

<p>In my free time, I love being outdoors no matter if it's the ocean or the mountains. I love to hike and to scuba dive.</p>
